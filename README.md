# Reverse-Prompting
Generating prompts from images. It can help in labeling dataset for Generative models like stable diffusion. It can also be used to help creators find and mimic inspirations from the creation of other artists.


# img_2_txt Models
LLaVA
GPT-4
BLIP-2
OpenFlamingo


# MiniGPT4

# How usually the finetuning of LLaVA happens?
1. Pretraining (2 hours)
2. Extract projector features
3. Visual instruction tuning (1 hour)

*authors have directly provided projector features. So we can directly jump to Visual instruction tuningâ€¦
